 🏠 House Price Prediction

A machine learning web application that predicts house prices based on various features like area, number of rooms, location, and more.  
This project demonstrates the end-to-end process of **data preprocessing, model training, and deployment** using **Flask**, **Scikit-learn**, and **Pandas**.


🚀 Features
- Predicts accurate house prices using regression models  
- Interactive web interface built with Flask  
- Clean data preprocessing pipeline with Pandas  
- Model trained using Scikit-learn (Linear Regression / Random Forest)  
- Easy to deploy on Render, Vercel, or Heroku  


🧠 Tech Stack
 1. Python 3.x
 2. Flask**
 3. Scikit-learn
 4.  Pandas
 5.  NumPy
 6.  Matplotlib / Seaborn


 🧩 Project Workflow
1. Data Collection and Cleaning  
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
